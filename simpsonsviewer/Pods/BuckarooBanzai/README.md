# BuckarooBanzai
### A new way to do networking in Swift. That other one is old AF.

BuckarooBanzai is based on service calls to specific API endpoints. These calls are encapsulated into objects that make it easy to reuse, modify and test additional resource paths for the same endpoint.

### Service
The `Service` protocol contains a number of required and optional parameters.
```swift
public protocol Service {
    var requestMethod: HTTPRequestMethod { get }
    var acceptType: HTTPAcceptType { get }
    var timeout: TimeInterval { get }
    var requestURL: String { get }
    var contentType: HTTPContentType? { get }
    var requestBody: Data? { get }
    var parameters: [AnyHashable: Any]? { get }
    var additionalHeaders: [AnyHashable: Any]? { get }
    var requestSerializer: RequestSerializer? { get }
    var sessionDelegate: URLSessionTaskDelegate? { get }
    var testResponse: HTTPResponse? { get }
}
```
Use this protocol to create a concrete struct or class. Here we are creating a base service to use for a specific resource domain.

```swift
import BuckarooBanzai

struct BaseService: Service {
    var requestMethod: HTTPRequestMethod = .GET
    var contentType: HTTPContentType?
    var acceptType: HTTPAcceptType = .JSON
    var timeout: TimeInterval = 10
    var requestURL: String = "https://httpbin.org"
    var requestBody: Data?
    var parameters: [AnyHashable: Any]?
    var additionalHeaders: [AnyHashable: Any]?
    var requestSerializer: RequestSerializer?
    var sessionDelegate: URLSessionTaskDelegate?
    var testResponse: HTTPResponse?

    /// create your custom initializer to add or update any properties
    init(withPath path: String, serviceParams: [AnyHashable: Any]? = nil) {
        requestURL = requestURL + path
        self.parameters = serviceParams
    }
}
```
Then you can create a service like the following:
```swift
let service = BaseService(withPath: "/get")
```
### BuckarooBanzai
BuckarooBanzai is a singleton and uses async/await. You can then use the `service` like this:
```swift
Task {
    do {
        let response = try await BuckarooBanzai.shared.start(service: service)
        /// do something with response
    } catch {
        print("ERROR: \(error)")
    }
}
```

### HTTPResponse
A successful `start(service:)` call will return an `HTTPResponse` object. This object contains properties of the service response.
```swift
public var statusCode: Int
public var headers: [AnyHashable: Any]
public var body: Data?
```
From here you can access the body data (if any) to perform any parsing required. The `HTTPResponse` also includes a couple of convenience methods for parsing the returned data. These include a method for parsing image data into a `UIImage` object and a method to decode a json payload into a `Codable` object. For example:
```swift
/// Decode body data into image
let webImage = try response.decodeBodyDataAsImage()

/// Decode into a custom object
let myObject: MyObject = try response.decodeBodyData()
```
Both of these methods throw so you can keep them inline with the `response` object.
```swift
do {
    let response = try await BuckarooBanzai.shared.start(service: service)
    let webImage = try response.decodeBodyDataAsImage()
    /// do something with image
} catch {
    print("ERROR: \(error)")
}
```

### Service Properties
#### requestMethod
The `requestMethod` is a required property that defines the HTTP method to be used for the request. The value for `requestMethod` is an enumeration of type `HTTPRequestMethod`:
```swift
case GET
case POST
case PUT
case DELETE
case HEAD
case CONNECT
case OPTIONS
case PATCH
case QUERY
case TRACE
case CUSTOM(String)
```
`.CUSTOM` can be used to match a type not listed or to match a custom HTTP method that your server will handle.

#### contentType
The `contentType` is an optional property that defines what format the body of the request is using. Mainly used for methods other than `.GET`, `.DELETE`, `.HEAD` or any other HTTP method that does not contain any body data. The value for `contentType` is an enumeration of type `HTTPContentType`:
```swift
case XML
case JSON
case FORM
case CUSTOM(String)
```
The following represents the strings that are used as the `Content-Type` header entry:
```swift
case .XML: return "application/xml"
case .JSON: return "application/json"
case .FORM: return "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
case .CUSTOM(let customType): return customType
```
`.CUSTOM` can be used to match a type not listed or to match a custom type your server will return.

When using `.JSON` or `.FORM`, BuckarooBanzai will automatically serialize the body parameters into the correct format and attach it as the body data.

When using any other type, you must provide a `requestSerializer` conforming to the `RequestSerializer` protocol. (see below for details)

**Note**: This automatic serialization only applies to request methods that will send body data.

#### acceptType
The `acceptType` is a required property that defines the expected body format returned from the server. The following are an enumeration of type `HTTPAcceptType`:
```swift
case XML
case JSON
case HTML
case TEXT
case JAVASCRIPT
case ANY
case CUSTOM(String)
```
The following represents the strings that are expected in the response `Content-Type` header entry:
```swift
case .XML: return "application/xml"
case .JSON: return "application/json"
case .HTML: return "text/html"
case .TEXT: return "text/plain"
case .JAVASCRIPT: return "text/javascript"
case .ANY: return "*/*"
case .CUSTOM(let customType): return customType
```

`.CUSTOM` can be used to match a custom type to be returned from your server.

BuckarooBanzai will check the `acceptType` against the type `Content-Type` returned in the server response header and throw an error if they do not match with some exceptions.

For example, if the `Service` object defines the `acceptType` as `.JSON`*(application/json)* but the server responds with `Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8`, the return type will split the value by semi-colons (;) and only match against the string before the first semi-colon.
